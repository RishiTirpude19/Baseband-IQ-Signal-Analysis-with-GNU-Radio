# GNU Radio-Based 8-QAM Signal Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the analysis and demodulation of an **unknown IQ baseband signal** using **GNU Radio Companion (GRC)**.  
The objective was to estimate key signal parameters, perform synchronization, and identify the correct modulation scheme.

## 🔬 Key Features
- Processed an IQ signal sampled at **512 kHz**.  
- Estimated a **symbol rate of 300 kHz** with approximately **3 samples per symbol**.  
- Determined a **zero carrier frequency offset** through spectral analysis.  
- Applied synchronization and carrier recovery techniques to stabilize the constellation.  
- Confirmed the modulation scheme as **8-QAM** using constellation visualization.

## 📈 Workflow
1. **Spectral Analysis**: Observed FFT of the IQ data to estimate symbol rate and carrier offset.  
2. **Synchronization**: Applied symbol timing recovery and carrier recovery for accurate demodulation.  
3. **Constellation Recovery**: Visualized constellation diagram to validate symbol mapping.  
4. **Modulation Detection**: Identified the signal modulation as **8-QAM**.
